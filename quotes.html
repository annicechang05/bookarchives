                I absolutely adore her and her writing style.

                  <p class="quote">“And that was the moment I realized: when the world felt dark and scary, love could 
                    whisk you off to go dancing; laughter could take some of the pain away; beauty could punch holes in your fear. 
                    I decided then that my life would be full of all three.”</p>

                  <p class="quote">“The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks 
                    and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how 
                    you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about...
                    Because if it’s this good when life is draining and mundane and hard, think of how wonderful it will be when the 
                    love songs are playing and the moon is out.”</p>
