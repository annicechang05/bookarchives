            <h2>These books are special to me, each in its own way. Some sparked my love for a genre, others pulled me in with 
            beautiful writing or unforgettable characters. A few stayed with me long after the last page, not just for the stories 
            they told, but for the emotions they stirred.</h2>

                  <h2>By. Emily Henry</h2>
                  <p>
                    This is the book that got me into reading and my introduction to Emily Henry, 
                    my favorite author. Her writing has so much depth and substance, and always bring me to tears. 
                    This was a perfectly paced slow-burn that had me completely invested in both characters.

                  <h2>By. Abby Jimenez</h2>
                  <p>This was my favorite book of 2024. Justin is the epitome of a perfect book boyfriend, and is definitely 
                    the standard. There is a quote in this book, that is far too long to include, but describes love
                    so beautifully. 10/10, no notes.

                        <p>I've never cried over a book as much as I did for this. Kristin Hannah's writing 
                            brought every single moment to life and I felt like I knew the characters intimately 
                            and was experiencing the war with them.

                        <h2>By. Taylor Jenkins Reid</h2>
                        <p>One of the most unique books I've read. It's entirely written as an interview, so we get all of
                            the character's POVs. This sucked me into the story and the writing was so good that 
                            the band felt like they were real.

                        <h1>Dance of Thieves</h1>
                        <h2>By. Mary E. Pearson</h2>
                        <p>This book consists of my favorite tropes in fantasy-romance books: fake dating, enemies to 
                            lovers, duty versus love, etc. These tropes came together perfectly in this book, and is definitely
                            the blueprint for books such as the Powerless trilogy.

                        <h2>By. Emily Henry</h2>
                        <p>While I did find the miscommunication a little frustrating, I loved the setting of this 
                            book, as well as the found family aspect. And again, I was rooting for the characters. 
                            Favorite quote: "In every universe, it’s you for me. Even if it’s not me for you.”

                        <p>Such an underrated series. This is the final book in the Prison Healer trilogy, and I found
                            myself attatched to the characters by the end of it. This series contained unpredicatable
                            cliff-hangers that made it so bingeable. Cried a few times for our characters.

                        <h2>By. Fredrik Backman</h2>
                        <p>This is a book that will stay with me for a very long time. This book was so well written, and  
                            Fredrik Backman's writing style kept me so engaged in the book, and wondering what was going to
                            happen to the characters.

                        <p>Annabel Monaghan is able to craft banter and chemistry between characters that feels 
                            palpable off the page. The writing is so comforting and I love the way the story is wrapped

                        <p>I  don't remember much about this book, I read it a few years ago. However, I do remember loving
                            it and reading all four books in a week. It was fast paced and I loved the characters,
                            as well as the romance between Elias and Laia.
